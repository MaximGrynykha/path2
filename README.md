# __Path2__

If you are not confident that your program will properly lead the way to the required file or directory - use Path2, it automatically converts all slashes to those which are used in the current operating system, yet so over also will trim excess slashes if there are in the path.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To install this library - run the command below in your terminal:

```shell
composer require maximgrynykha/path2
```

## Usage  

```php
<?php

use Path2\Path;

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

// For example, normalize some kinky path
$normalized = Path::to('/\/src/\\\Path2/\/\/\Path.php');

dd($normalized); // "{CWD}/src/Path2/Path.php" (on an UNIX) || "{CWD}\src\Path2\Path.php" (on a Windows)
                 
                 // Note, by default if any preceding to the main path (first argument),
                 // from-path (second argument) isn't passed then Path::to()
                 // uses CWD (current working directory) as a preceding, from-path.
```
